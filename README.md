# tryagain-gamejam-22-08-2022
Try Again was to be a procedural game. 
The player goes through rooms containing enemies, which have to be killed 
before being able to proceed. Every time the player dies, 
he'll have to start at the beginning (the world doesn't change). 
After death, an afterimage is created which copies every move done by the player
in an earlier 'run', the afterimage dissolves in a place where the player died last time.

## Unfinished
This project remains unfinished as a reminder of the lesson: limit scope and do instead
of thinking about doing.

The game was supposed to be a procedural platformer action game. But I didn't end up
having to crap that idea, because of poor time management.

The were supposed to be more enemies and they were supposed to telegraf their moves.
Again, time and scope.

The afterimage system was not working 100% of the time. Sometimes it would just perform
the moves a frame later or so. Meaning they would completely miss a wall for a wall jump
and mess up the whole route. Didn't end up having time to fix it.

## Conclusion
As a first game jam, it allowed me to learn to limit scope and actually made me work
as I should, when the second one came up.
